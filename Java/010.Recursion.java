> Java Recursion
In Java, a method that calls itself is known as a recursive method. And, this process is known as recursion.

A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other. Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.

> Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion

When a recursive call is made, new storage locations for variables are allocated on the stack.
  As, each recursive call returns, the old variables and parameters are removed from the stack.
  Hence, recursion generally uses more memory and is generally slow.

On the other hand, a recursive solution is much simpler and takes less time to write, debug and maintain.
