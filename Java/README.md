# Java JDK, JRE and JVM

## What is JVM?

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.

When you run the Java program, Java compiler first compiles your Java code to bytecode. Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code (set of instructions that a computer's CPU executes directly).

Java is a platform-independent language. It's because when you write Java code, it's ultimately written for JVM but not your physical machine (computer). Since JVM executes the Java bytecode which is platform-independent, Java is platform-independent.
