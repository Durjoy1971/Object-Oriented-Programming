# Java JDK, JRE and JVM

## What is JVM?

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.

When you run the Java program, Java compiler first compiles your Java code to bytecode. Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code (set of instructions that a computer's CPU executes directly).

Java is a platform-independent language. It's because when you write Java code, it's ultimately written for JVM but not your physical machine (computer). Since JVM executes the Java bytecode which is platform-independent, Java is platform-independent.

## What is JRE?
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that provides Java class libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components that are required to run Java applications.

JRE is the superset of JVM.

## What is JDK?
JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit required to develop applications in Java. When you download JDK, JRE is also downloaded with it.

In addition to JRE, JDK also contains a number of development tools (compilers, JavaDoc, Java Debugger, etc).
